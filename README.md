# Pirate Kittens Typing Game

## Background and Overview
Pirate Kittens Typing Game is an animated JavaScript Typing Game with a pastel rainbow aesthetic. Pirate kittens will sail in from the left side of the screen while the player defends him/her treasure from the right by correctly typing the words that appear in the water. As the words are typed correctly, waves will slow the kittens down. Eventually, more and more pirate kittens will enter the screen, forcing the player to type faster and faster to keep them at bay. The game is over when the kittens reach the treasure.

The graphics are inspired by Lisa Frank animals but will have a more pastel tone.
